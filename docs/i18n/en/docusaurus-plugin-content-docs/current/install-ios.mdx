# iOS Settings
## iOS Settings

:::info
If you are using Expo, you should skip this document, excluding console settings.
:::

Refer to the [Kakao SDK Documentation](https://developers.kakao.com/docs/latest/ko/ios/getting-started) for more detailed information on the settings.

Here is how you configure the iOS part:

## Create an Application and Register a Platform in Kakao Console

![feat1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mym0404/image-archive/master/202404211426201.webp)

As shown in the picture above, you add an application in the [Kakao Developers Console](https://developers.kakao.com/console/app).

Now, navigate to the platform tab, add an iOS app, and register the Bundle Identifier, etc.

## Add Allowed List for App Execution

`LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` is an option in `Info.plist` that specifies which schemes the app can open.

Add the following three:

-  `kakaokompassauth`: [Kakao Login](https://developers.kakao.com/docs/latest/ko/kakaologin/common)
-  `kakaolink`: [Share on KakaoTalk](https://developers.kakao.com/docs/latest/ko/message/common#kakaotalk-sharing)
-  `kakaoplus`: [KakaoTalk channel](https://developers.kakao.com/docs/latest/ko/kakaotalk-channel/common)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mym0404/image-archive/master/202404211447772.webp)

Configured `Info.plist` looks like this:

```property title='Info.plist'
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
  <array>
      <!-- Login with KakaoTalk -->
      <string>kakaokompassauth</string>
      <!-- Share on KakaoTalk -->
      <string>kakaolink</string>
      <!-- KakaoTalk channel -->
      <string>kakaoplus</string>
  </array>
```

:::warning
Warning: Key Change for Allowed List Settings
With Xcode 14 or higher, the key for allowed list settings may automatically change from LSApplicationQueriesSchemes to Queried URL Schemes.

In the Info.plist file, continue using the previous key when manually editing.
:::

## Adding a Custom URL Scheme

You set up a custom URL scheme for launching the service app.

In **[Info] > [URL Types] > [URL Schemes]**, register the native app key in the format `kakao{{NATIVE_APP_KEY}}`.
For example, if the native app key is `123456789`, you would enter `kakao123456789` in [URL Schemes].
