[Official Documentation](https://developers.kakao.com/docs/latest/ko/message/android-link#create-message)

This message format displays product information including the price. While it may not allow for adding as long text as a feed template or including social information, it has the advantage of informing users about the price information.

Use Case: It is suitable for informing users about products sold in online shopping malls or promoting items by including price information (regular price, discount price, discount rate).
