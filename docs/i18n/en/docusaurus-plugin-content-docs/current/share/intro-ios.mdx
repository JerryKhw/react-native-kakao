## Passing Additional Information at App Launch

For native apps, you can pass additional information at app launch through the custom URL scheme. Set keys and values to be passed at the app launch using the `androidExecutionParams` and `iosExecutionParams` parameters.
When using these parameters, clicking the button in a KakaoTalk shared message will trigger the scheme as shown below.

```
kakao${YOUR_NATIVE_APP_KEY}://kakaolink?key1=value1&key2=value2&key3=value3
```

:::note
For more detailed information, refer to the [Official Documentation](https://developers.kakao.com/docs/latest/ko/message/android-link#custom-scheme).
