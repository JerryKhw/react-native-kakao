# Select KakaoTalk Friends

## Selecting KakaoTalk Friends

[Official Documentation](https://developers.kakao.com/docs/latest/ko/kakaotalk-social/android#picker-friends)

:::info
To use the API, the user must have agreed to Kakao login and consent items related to the profile information, nickname, and profile picture.

The picker and get friends list API can only be used in apps granted permission.
Before getting permission, the feature is restricted to the app team members only. To enable the feature for all users in a live service, you need to apply for permission in `[My Applications] > [Request App Permissions]`.

For information on requesting permissions, refer to the [Official Documentation](https://developers.kakao.com/docs/latest/ko/kakaotalk-social/common#policy-request-permission).

If the consent items are set to be used during usage, when trying to call the API that uses the function, permissions prompt like the image above will be displayed.
