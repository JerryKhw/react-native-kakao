[Official Documentation](https://developers.kakao.com/docs/latest/ko/kakaotalk-channel/ios#check-relationship)

You can check the KakaoTalk channel relationship using the `channels` function.

```tsx
export function channels(params: { channelPublicIds?: string[] } = {}): Promise<KakaoChannel[]>
```

- `channelPublicIds`: IDs of the channels to check the relationship. If not provided, it checks all channels.

The types used are as follows:

  uuid: string;
  encodedId: string;
  relation: 'added' | 'none' | 'blocked' | 'unknown';
  updatedAt?: number; // unix
}
```
