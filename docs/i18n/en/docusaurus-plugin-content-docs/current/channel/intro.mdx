# Getting Started with Kakao Channel

## Before You Begin

Make sure to install the dependencies for the `Core` package by referring to the [official installation guide](/docs/install-core). Also, complete the [platform-specific configurations](/docs/install-android).

## Getting Started

The `channel` package allows you to interact with KakaoTalk channels.

KakaoTalk Channel (formerly Plus Friends) is a service that allows KakaoTalk users to receive various service updates in the form of messages and posts.

KakaoTalk Channel provides the functionality to send marketing messages to friends. Friends refer to users who have added the KakaoTalk channel as a friend.

KakaoTalk Channel messages can be sent to a targeted group of users based on their gender, age, location, grade, and other information to achieve higher effectiveness and cost savings.

Refer to the [Official Documentation](https://developers.kakao.com/docs/latest/ko/kakaotalk-channel/common) for more details.
