# Expo Configuration

## Android - Register Activity for App Launch After Channel Addition

[Official Documentation](https://developers.kakao.com/docs/latest/ko/kakaotalk-channel/android#set-custom-url-scheme)

To enable the easy addition of KakaoTalk channels, you need to configure the activity in the `AndroidManifest.xml`. This setting is for supporting the internal redirection used in this feature. Refer to the example below.

Add the following to `app.json`:

```json title='app.json'
[
  "@react-native-kakao/core",
  {
    "nativeAppKey": "{{native app key}}",
    "android": {
// highlight-next-line
      "followChannelHandlerActivity": true
    }
  }
],
```
