# Start Route Guidance to Destination

## Start Route Guidance to Destination

[Official Documentation](https://developers.kakao.com/docs/latest/ko/kakaonavi/android)

## Usage

You can start route guidance to the destination by launching the Kakao Navigation app using the `navigateTo()` function.

It is defined as follows:

```tsx
export function navigateTo(params: {
  destination: KakaoNaviLocation;
  option?: KakaoNaviOption;
  viaList?: KakaoNaviLocation[];
  openWebInstallUrlIfNaviAppNotAvailable?: boolean;
}): Promise<boolean>
```

-  `destination`: The destination information, which is a required parameter.
-  `option`: Options for navigation.
-  `viaList`: List of via points.
-  `openWebInstallUrlIfNaviAppNotAvailable`: Whether to automatically redirect to the installation screen if Kakao Navigation app is not available.
The default value is `true`.

For detailed explanations of the options, refer to the [Official Documentation](https://developers.kakao.com/docs/latest/ko/kakaonavi/android#set-parameter).

:::info
Since Navi has a specific option that guides the installation process, if the app execution fails, the `Package-KakaoAppNotAvailable` error code will not be rejected as a `Promise`.

Instead, you can determine if the app was executed without issues based on the resolved result.
:::

:::warning
Route guidance is not available on the web platform.

If on a mobile web, the browser will be redirected to the Kakao Navi execution/installation guide screen if the Kakao Navigation app is not available.

For desktop web, nothing will happen.

This is an announcement of the end of support for route guidance on the Kakao Navi web version from Kakao's JavaScript SDK.
