# Getting Android Key Hash

## Getting Android Key Hash

This is a utility function that easily retrieves the key hash in Android environments.

```tsx title='index.js'
import { getKeyHashAndroid } from '@react-native-kakao/core';

getKeyHashAndroid().then(console.log);
```

:::info
This function can simply utilize `console.log` as shown above in a debug environment where the console is visible,

In non-debug (release) environments, itâ€™s possible to display the key using a component like `Text` to retrieve it accurately.

Of course, you can extract the key hash manually without this utility by following the [Official Documentation](https://developers.kakao.com/docs/latest/ko/android/getting-started#before-you-begin-add-key-hash).
