# Expo Settings

## Expo Settings

Expo allows you to easily use pre-configured [config plugins](https://docs.expo.dev/config-plugins/introduction/).

:::tip
If the features provided by this package are not enough, and you need more components from the config plugin,
refer to the [Android Settings](/docs/install-android) and [iOS Settings](/docs/install-ios) for instructions on how to write and use them yourself.
:::

## Installation of expo-build-properties

```shell
npx expo install expo-build-properties
```

## app.json Settings

Initially, there are not many settings to configure, but as you use other packages, you add the necessary settings for `android` and `ios`.

```json title='app.json'
"plugins": [
  [
    "expo-build-properties",
    {
      "android": {
        "extraMavenRepos": [
          "https://devrepo.kakao.com/nexus/content/groups/public/"
        ]
      }
    }
  ],
  [
    "@react-native-kakao/core",
    {
      "nativeAppKey": "{{native app key}}",
      "android": {
        ...
      },
      "ios": {
        ...
      }
    }
  ]
]
```

## (Optional) Android Obfuscation Settings

Refer to the [Android Settings](/docs/install-android) to inject proguard rules using the [expo-build-properties](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/build-properties/)
config plugin.

## (Optional) Web Platform Support

Proceed in the same manner as the [Web Settings](/docs/install-web).
