## Setting Up URL Handling for KakaoTalk Login

Refer to the [Official Documentation](https://developers.kakao.com/docs/latest/ko/kakaologin/ios#before-you-begin-setting-for-kakaotalk) for the essential configuration to implement KakaoTalk login functionality.

Follow the [instructions](https://developers.kakao.com/docs/latest/ko/ios/getting-started#project-plist) to add KakaoTalk to the app's Allowlist to launch KakaoTalk from the app and set up a [custom URL scheme](https://developers.kakao.com/docs/latest/ko/documentation-guideline/glossary#%E3%85%8B) to return to the service app.

KakaoTalk login involves the process of transitioning from the service app to KakaoTalk and back after the user presses the [Agree and Continue] button or cancels the login.

To ensure the proper completion of the Kakao login process when returning from KakaoTalk to the service app, add the following steps to the `AppDelegate.mm` file.

```objc
#import "AppDelegate.h"

// highlight-start
#import <React/RCTLinkingManager.h>
#import <RNCKakaoUser/RNCKakaoUserUtil.h>
// highlight-end

@implementation AppDelegate

...

// highlight-start
// Linking API
-  (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url options:(NSDictionary<UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey,id> *)options {

  // Handling logic in this app if the URL scheme is from KakaoTalk.
  if([RNCKakaoUserUtil isKakaoTalkLoginUrl:url]) {
    return [RNCKakaoUserUtil handleOpenUrl:url];
  }

  return [super application:application openURL:url options:options] || [RCTLinkingManager application:application openURL:url options:options];
}
// highlight-end

...

@end

```
