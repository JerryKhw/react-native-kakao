## Logging In

You can perform tasks like user registration, login, receiving additional consent, and obtaining agreement for terms using Kakao Login.

## Usage

Calling the `login()` function will trigger the login process immediately.

```tsx
import { login } from '@react-native-kakao/user';

...

// highlight-next-line
login()
```

### Parameters

All parameters are optional.

-  `serviceTerms`: Additional feature to specify specific service terms for the Kakao login consent screen, based on the user's service registration scenario. Specify the service terms tags to be included in the consent screen by setting the `serviceTerms` parameter when making a Kakao login request. Include one or more service terms set as [required consent] to display the consent screen and obtain user consent.

:::info
This feature is only available for services implementing Kakao Sync.
:::

-  `prompts`: Allows control over the login process by passing flags.

Pass `Login`, `Create`, `Cert`, `UnifyDaum`, or `SelectAccount(Android only)` as a `string[]`.

For detailed descriptions, refer to the [Official Documentation](https://developers.kakao.com/docs/latest/ko/kakaologin/ios#request-code-re-authentication).

:::info
Sent when attempting a login with a Kakao account instead of KakaoTalk.
:::

-  `scopes`: Used when requesting additional consent from the user. Pass the items that require consent.

Refer to the [Official Documentation](https://developers.kakao.com/docs/latest/ko/kakaologin/android#request-code-additional-consent) for details.

Check the `xxxNeedsAgreement` properties in the `me()` function to get items that require additional consent.

If `scopes` are provided, it always executes login with a Kakao account.

-  `useKakaoAccountLogin`: Attempt login with a Kakao account instead of KakaoTalk.

:::warning Warning
Errors will be thrown under the following conditions:
-  If `useKakaoAccountLogin` does not exist or is `false`, `prompts` and `scopes` cannot be passed.

For KakaoTalk login, `prompts` and `scopes` cannot be passed (Native SDK restriction).

-  If `scopes` are passed, `serviceTerms` and `prompts` cannot be passed.

When requesting additional consent, `serviceTerms` and `prompts` cannot be passed together (Native SDK restriction).

### Response

The response includes the following:

```tsx title='KakaoLoginToken'
{
  accessToken: string;
  refreshToken: string;
  tokenType?: string;
  idToken?: string;
  accessTokenExpiresAt: number; // unix
  refreshTokenExpiresAt: number; // unix
  accessTokenExpiresIn: number; // seconds
  refreshTokenExpiresIn: number; // seconds
  scopes: string[];
};
```

## Logging Out

You can log out using `logout()`.

## Revoking Account Linkage

Use `unlink()` to revoke account linkage.

## Checking Current Login Status

Use `isLogined()` to check if the user is currently logged in. It returns a `Promise<boolean>`.

## Checking KakaoTalk Availability

Use `isKakaoTalkLoginAvailable()` to check if KakaoTalk login is available. It returns a `Promise<boolean>`.
