## How APIs and Documentation Are Maintained

:::tip
This document does not cover all details about the basic configuration or APIs of the Kakao SDK.
We recommend referring to the Official Documentation of Kakao SDK for the required functionalities.

Minimal setup or APIs usage to utilize this package are covered.
:::

The structure of APIs and modules follows the structure of the [Kakao SDK](https://developers.kakao.com/docs/latest/ko/ios/getting-started).

Names of functions or modules are generally determined by looking at the iOS documentation, and `Common` is replaced with `Core`.

For example, there is a `User` module in the image above, hence `@react-native-kakao/user` exists.

:::info
Always refer to the related Official Documentation to understand what permissions and setups each API requires to function properly and how errors may occur or the operation may proceed otherwise.
